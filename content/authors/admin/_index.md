I am a PhD student in [Menche Lab](www.menchelab.com) working in the field of Network Medicine at [Max Perutz Labs](www.maxperutzlabs.ac.at) and the Research Center for Molecular Medicine ([CeMM](www.cemm.at)) in beautiful Vienna, Austria. 

Before that, I was an Erasmus Mundus master's student in Computational and Systems Biology at [KTH](https://www.kth.se/en) & [Aalto](https://www.aalto.fi/en). Biology is becoming increasingly quantitative, and I enjoy bringing my physics/computational backgrounds to solve modern biomedical challenges. Beyond my academic sphere, I often find myself travelling, cycling, cooking, and hiking (:sun:) / skiing (:snowflake:).
